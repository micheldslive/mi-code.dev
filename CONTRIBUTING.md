# Contribution Guidelines

When contributing to `micode.dev`, whether on GitHub or in other community spaces:

- Be respectful, civil, and open-minded.
- Before opening a new pull request, try searching through the [issue tracker](https://github.com/micheldslive/micode.dev/issues) for known issues or fixes.
- If you want to make code changes based on your personal opinion(s), make sure you open an issue first describing the changes you want to make, and open a pull request only when your suggestions get approved by maintainers.

## How to Contribute

### Prerequisites

In order to not waste your time implementing a change that has already been declined, or is generally not needed, start by [opening an issue](https://github.com/micheldslive/micode.dev/issues/new/choose) describing the problem you would like to solve.

### Setup your environment locally

_Some commands will assume you have the Github CLI installed, if you haven't, consider [installing it](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation), but you can always use the Web UI if you prefer that instead._

In order to contribute to this project, you will need to fork the repository:

```bash
gh repo fork micheldslive/micode.dev
```

then, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
gh repo clone <your-github-name>/micode.dev
```

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) as its package manager. Install it if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Then, install the project's dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Here are some useful scripts for when you are developing:

| Command         | Description                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm dev`      | Builds and starts the project in watch-mode |
| `pnpm build`    | Builds the project                          |
| `pnpm teste`    | Run project test cases                      |
| `pnpm format`   | Formats the code                            |
| `pnpm lint`     | Lints the code                              |
| `pnpm lint:fix` | Lints the code and fixes any errors         |

When making commits, make sure to follow the [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) guidelines, i.e. prepending the message with `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, etc... You can use `git status` to double check which files have not yet been staged for commit:

```bash
git add <file> && git commit -m "feat/fix/chore/docs: commit message"
```

### When you're done

Check that your code follows the project's style guidelines by running:

```bash
pnpm check
```

Please also make a manual, functional test of your changes.

When all that's done, it's time to file a pull request to upstream:

**NOTE**: All pull requests should target the `main` branch.

```bash
gh pr create --web
```

and fill out the title and body appropriately. Again, make sure to follow the [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) guidelines for your title.
